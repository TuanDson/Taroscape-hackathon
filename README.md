## Inspiration
*Our website centers around the concept of "Daily Theme", integrating the mysterious tarot card predictions into the daily life rhythm of users, creating an interactive experience platform full of ritual and emotional connection. We hope to guide users through daily updated themes, helping them focus on the issues that concern them most at present and find a moment of tranquility for self-reflection in their busy lives. 
Tarot is not merely a divination tool, but also a medium for emotional resonance and inner exploration. Our website design aims to create an immersive psychological sanctuary for users with a gentle and dreamy visual style, smooth interaction experience, and multiple card-drawing methods in line with standard Tarot rules. 
Through the "Daily Theme" setting, users can have a heart-to-heart talk with themselves under the guidance of different themes every day. We hope that this platform can not only offer the function of tarot prediction, but also become a way for users to record their own emotions and the trajectory of cognitive growth.*
